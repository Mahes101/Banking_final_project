# Banking_final_project
Objective: The objective of this project is to leverage advanced data analytics 
techniques, including classification, regression, and clustering, to extract valuable 
insights and enhance decision-making processes within the banking sector. The 
project aims to address various aspects of banking operations, such as customer 
segmentation, credit risk assessment, and performance prediction.
Key Components: 
1. Customer Segmentation (Clustering): 
 Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on their banking 
behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.

3. Credit Risk Assessment (Classification): 
 Develop a robust credit scoring system using classification algorithms to 
assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. 
 Utilize historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default 
or late payments. 
 Enhance risk management by integrating machine learning models into the 
credit approval process.

5. Performance Prediction (Regression): 
 Build regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the 
banking institution, such as asset growth, revenue, and profitability. 
 Analyze the impact of various factors, such as economic indicators and market 
trends, on the bank's performance. 
 Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, investment 
strategies, and overall business performance.

Technological Stack: 
 Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling. 
 Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for implementing machine learning algorithms. 
 Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab for code development and documentation. 
 Visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for data exploration and 
presentation.
